#### Guidelines

* Please be respectful to one another.
* Many contributors are volunteering their time.  We might not get to your
issue right away.  Be patient.
* Other contributors have different backgrounds and perspectives than you do.
Diversity is a community strength.
* We will disagree sometimes.  That's ok.  When this happens, assume that the
person with whom you disagree is a smart person with good reasons for believing
something different.
* Everyone has bad days.  If you find yourself about to be mean to someone,
take a break and cool off.  This project will still be here later.
* When you make a mistake, apologize.


#### We will not tolerate

* Sexualized language or imagery
* Hate speech
* Personal attacks
* Trolling or insulting/derogatory comments
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing other's private information
* Plagiarism
* Other unethical or unprofessional conduct

When we disagree, try to understand why: Disagreements, both social and
technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements
and differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. The
strength of our community comes from its diversity, people from a wide range of
backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being
unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn’t mean that they’re
wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn’t
get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from
mistakes.

Our community is based on mutual respect, tolerance, and encouragement, and we
are working to help each other live up to these principles. We want our
community to be more diverse: whoever you are, and whatever your background, we
welcome you.
